# RandomPasswordGenerator
A random password generator!


In this challenge, we were given a prebuilt website with a random password generator that did not work. The challenge was to add Javascript code to make the password generator functional! I struggled quite a bit with this one as Javascript is a little bit more challenging for me but with the help of several resources I was able to figure out my difficulties. The link below will lead you to a completed and fully functional random password generator!
